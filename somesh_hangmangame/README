2. CSS (hangmanstyles.css):
- Styles the game with a dark, gradient background
- Implements responsive design for various screen sizes
- Provides animations and transitions for a more engaging user experience
- Styles the hangman figure, word display, and UI elements

3.JavaScript (hangmanscript.js):
- Manages the game logic
- Randomly selects words from a predefined list
- Handles user input (keypress events)
- Updates the display of correct and incorrect guesses
- Manages the hangman figure display
- Implements win/lose conditions and game reset functionality

Key features:
- Interactive hangman figure that appears part by part with incorrect guesses
